    <section id="About me">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm from Huntingburg, Indiana, and currently study Computer Science at Purdue University. After I graduate,
        my plan is to work as a Software Developer.</p>
            <p>Although I'm a programmer and tech enthusiast, I might be a
        liberal arts student at heart. In addition to major in CS, I'm also pursuing a degree in Spanish, and have
        made contributions to the Purdue Exponent, one of the nation's top student-run collegiate newspapers.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I enjoy practicing my Spanish, cooking, traveling, reading (mostly non-fiction), and
        the occasional bike ride. In 2025, I plan to go on a semester-long study abroad to either Mexico or
        Colombia, where I will continue my studies and hone my working proficiency of Spanish.</p>
        <p>I am very excited about someday working in the Software Development industry. We are
        currently amidst a great technological revolution—technologies like generative AI, virtual reality, and
        quantum computing are only in their infancy. It will be a privilege to work with and develop
        these technologies in my career, and I hope to make my own small impact on the future.</p>
        <p>One of my core philosophies is that good software and products are dependent upon thoughtful,
        user-oriented engineers. Even the smallest decisions will inevitably affect
        the end user.</p>
        <p>During an Apple event, Steve Jobs once said, "Technology alone is not enough—that's technology, married with liberal arts...
        that yields us the result that make our hearts sing."</p>
        <p>This was Apple's core philosophy, one which I identify with greatly. It's the reason why Apple,
        and not IBM, HP, or Microsoft, is the world's most successful company. Steve Jobs did not just have an
        engineering perspective, but also a humanistic one.</p>
        <p>In my career, I hope I can leverage my unique background to create software that embodies this philosophy.</p>

        <p>In addition to proficiency in the languages above, I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and
        Javascript.</p>
        <p>I don't much experience working with these languages in a production environment; I'm currently in search of
        a job, internship, or extracurricular activity that will allow me to practice my skills.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h4>Implementing Basic Data Structures in C++ (In progress)</h4>
    <a href="url">Github repository</a>

    <p>In my CS 251 course, students were required to implement various data structures in Java. I plan to implement
    these same data structures in C++ in my own time. This project will not only help me master these data structures,
    but it will also teach me the fundamentals of C++.</p>

    <h4>Personal Website</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/braydenreimann/Brayden-Reimann-s-Website">Github repository</a>

    <p>I decided to start this project because I wanted to learn how to build a website from the ground-up, using
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I found myself overwhelmed by the web development stack, so I decided that I would not
    use any frameworks for this project.</p>

    <p>I learned a lot in the process of creating this website, and I now feel confident enough
    to use them in a professional setting and on more advanced future projects.</p>
